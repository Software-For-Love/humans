## Nominate Form
This form will send information to us about any potential nominations. The nominator's information will also be recorded along with any relevant information about the nominee.

If the person is to be featured, the data should be extracted from the nomination form and put into the format detailed in the feature.md file.

Descriptions should be made about the nominee by using the nominator's response to the "Why Should They Be Featured?" question as well as any information that can be collected through social media pages.

Nominee photos and their current position can be gathered through public social media pages, if they are not available in the nominator's responses.
